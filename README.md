# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction (UCI Dataset)

Predict student grades and pass/fail status using Machine Learning on the UCI Student Performance Dataset.  
This project explores how academic, social, and personal factors influence student achievement.

---

## 📘 Project Overview
This project applies data analysis and machine learning to predict student performance.  
It includes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **data preprocessing**, and **modeling** (Regression & Classification).  
The goal is to identify key factors that affect students’ final grades.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visual insights  
- ⚙️ Data preprocessing (encoding, scaling, cleaning)  
- 🧮 Regression for grade prediction (G3)  
- 🎯 Classification for pass/fail prediction  
- 🔍 Feature importance visualization  
- 📈 Model evaluation (R², MSE, Accuracy, F1-score)

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **Libraries:**
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-performance-prediction.git
   cd student-performance-prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Student_Performance_Prediction.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the notebook cells step-by-step to reproduce results.

## 📈 Results
- **Regression:** Random Forest achieved strong predictive accuracy with high R² score.  
- **Classification:** Pass/Fail model reached ~90% accuracy.  
- **Key Factors:** G1, G2, study time, and absences had the most influence on grades.

## 🌟 Future Work
- Add **hyperparameter tuning** (GridSearchCV)  
- Develop a **Streamlit web app** for live predictions  
- Integrate **SHAP/LIME** for model explainability
